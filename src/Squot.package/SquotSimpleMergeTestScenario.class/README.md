I create three versions that together form a V-shaped history.
The firstVersion comes at the base. Two other versions are children of it.
The secondVersion is on the main historian, the thirdVersion is created by the otherHistorian.
All versions contain a single sampleClass and a few methods depending on the concrete scenario (see subclasses).
