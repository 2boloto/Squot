I wrap a SquotArtifact that is loaded in a SquotWorkingCopy. Actually the objects live in the working copy's store (e. g. SquotImageStore), but as an object container, the working copy can also be asked for artifacts. I allow to set how the objects will get serialized when stored to a file system store. This is used to switch packages between Cypress and Tonel formats, for example.
