I collect Artifacts to bundle them into a Snapshot. I am mostly here to let Snapshots appear immutable...

Instance Variables
	artifacts:		<Dictionary> of added artifacts. The artifacts' paths are the keys.
	loadOrder:		<SequenceableCollection> of paths that determine the recommended loading order of the artifacts.
