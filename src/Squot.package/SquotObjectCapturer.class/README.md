I generate a graph of Metaobjects from a graph of objects.

Instance Variables
	convertedObjects:		<IdentitiyDictionary> already converted objects (or in progress)
	rootCopy:		<Object> copy of rootObject
	rootMetaobject:		<SquotMetaobject> the top metaobject that conserves rootObject
	rootObject:		<Object> the top object from which the conversion starts
