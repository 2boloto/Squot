I am a Pur Snapshot wrapper of an object. I carry either the object itself or a model of it. For certain types of stores I carry additional information that should direct them how to properly restore me.

Instance Variables
	content:		the captured object or a model of it
	path:		the path at which the content was stored
	storeInfo:		directions for Stores how to restore the content
