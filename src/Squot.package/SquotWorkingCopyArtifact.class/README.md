I wrap a SquotArtifact that belongs to my SquotWorkingCopy. Loaded objects actually live in the working copy's store (e. g. SquotImageStore), but as an object container, the working copy itself can as well be asked for artifacts. I allow to set how the objects will get serialized when stored to a file system store. This is used to switch packages between Cypress and Tonel formats, for example.
