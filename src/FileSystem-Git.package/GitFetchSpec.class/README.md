I am a GitRefSpec found in the git config in options named 'remote.<name>.fetch' to configure how remote-tracking branches are created.

My left-side pattern denotes the remote ref, the right-side pattern the local remote-tracking branch ref.

Instance variables:
	remote:		<GitRemote> the remote to which this fetch spec belongs
